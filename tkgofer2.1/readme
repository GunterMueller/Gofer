-- Koen Claessen, Ton Vullinghs, 1997
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the readme file for TkGofer 2.0.
Please read this file before installation.
An installation guide can be found in Doc/install.doc.

-- Requirements --

To start TkGofer you should first install Tk (version 4.2
or higher) and Tcl (version 7.6 or higher). Both packages
can be obtained via anoymous ftp, for example from
ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/Tcl.

TkGofer runs on any machine that runs Tcl/Tk and Gofer.

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- I. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The distribution contains the following directories:

  Bin/                   -- location of the binaries
  Doc/                   -- documentation
  Examples/              -- many small and big example programs in TkGofer
  Tcl/                   -- necessary Tcl scripts

The following directories are only used during installation:

  Modules/         -- sources in gofer
  Sources/         -- sources in c
  Skeletons/       -- file masks

After installation, there will another directory:

  Preludes/        -- several preludes that you can choose

Then there are the following files:

  readme           -- this file
  tkgofer.install  -- install script

For information on how to use the install script, see II.

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- II. INSTALLATION

For help with installation, we wrote an installation guide. It
is the document called

  Doc/install.doc

Please read that document carefully before installation. The install
script tkgofer.install will be used to do the installation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- III. DOCUMENTATION

The documentation directory contains several information providing
documents:

  Doc/install.doc        -- installation guide
  Doc/gofer.doc          -- the Gofer readme file
  Doc/release.notes.doc  -- the release notes for this version
  Doc/signatures.doc     -- the signatures of all the files that the
                            TkGofer library provides

Further, it contains the help files for some scripts:

  Doc/install.help       -- help for the tkgofer.install script
  Doc/make.prelude.help  -- help for the make.prelude script
  Doc/tkgofer.help       -- help for the tkgofer script

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- IV. MODULES and PRELUDES

The libraries of TkGofer are split up in several module, each presenting
its own functionality. During installation, several preludes will be built,
each containing another subset of these modules.

  Modules/prelude.gs          -- almost equal to the standard cc.prelude
  Modules/guiMonad.gs         -- definition of the GUI monad
  Modules/widget.gs           -- widget definitions
  Modules/io.gs               -- (file) io functions
  Modules/time.gs             -- functions dealing with time
  Modules/concurrent.gs       -- concurrency library

From these modules, the following preludes will be created during
installation. They all contain prelude.gs and guiMonad.gs.

  Preludes/tk.prelude-all     -- widget.gs time.gs io.gs concurrent.gs
  Preludes/tk.prelude-std     -- widget.gs
  Preludes/tk.prelude-mini    -- ()
  Preludes/tk.prelude-conc    -- widget.gs concurrent.gs
  Preludes/tk.prelude-noconc  -- widget.gs time.gs io.gs

----------------------------------------------------------------
-- V. EXAMPLES

The example directory contains a lot of examples, divided the following main
groups:

  Examples/SmallExamples    -- examples dealing with one feature explicitly
  Examples/ComposedWidgets  -- how to define your won widgets
  Examples/Mvc              -- an mvc library, with separate examples
  Examples/Animation        -- an animation library, with separate examples
  Examples/Concurrency      -- some concurrency examples
  Examples/Fudgets          -- a small implementation of Fudgets
  Examples/Machine          -- an abstract machine simulator
  Examples/Tree             -- the tree widget, with examples
  Examples/Turtle           -- two implementations of a graphics turtle
